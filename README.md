# FizzBuzzTDD

Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) 
has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.
Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial
problem for any would-be computer programmer,
so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability. 

# TDD
This simple programming exercise was written using Test Driven Development.
First I coded tests and then I changed the FizzBuzzConverter class to fit the tests.
Finally I added one more test.
